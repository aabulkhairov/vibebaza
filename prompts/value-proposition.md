# Value Proposition Generator

Develop powerful value propositions that clearly communicate your unique value.

## Prompt Template

```
Create a value proposition for my product/service using these inputs:

**Product/Service:** [Name and brief description]
**Target Customer:** [Who you serve]
**Main Problem Solved:** [The key pain point you address]
**Key Benefits:** [3-5 main benefits]
**Differentiators:** [What makes you unique vs. competitors]
**Proof Points:** [Evidence like stats, testimonials, awards]

Generate:
1. One-liner value prop (under 10 words)
2. Elevator pitch (30 seconds / 75 words)
3. Full value proposition statement (following the format below)
4. Three headline variations for landing pages
```

## Value Proposition Framework

**For** [target customer]
**Who** [statement of need or opportunity]
**Our** [product/service name]
**Is** [product category]
**That** [key benefit/reason to buy]
**Unlike** [competitive alternative]
**Our product** [primary differentiation]

## Example Output

**One-liner:** "Turn sales data into closed deals, automatically."

**Elevator Pitch:** "Sales teams waste 30% of their time on admin work instead of selling. Our AI-powered platform automates data entry, prioritizes leads, and tells reps exactly who to call next. Companies using us close 40% more deals without adding headcount."

**Full Statement:** For B2B sales teams who struggle with manual processes and scattered data, SalesFlow is an AI-powered sales platform that automates administrative work and surfaces actionable insights. Unlike traditional CRMs that require constant maintenance, SalesFlow works in the background so reps can focus on selling.
