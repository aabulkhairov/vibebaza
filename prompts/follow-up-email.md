## Follow-Up Scenarios

### Post-Demo (2 days)
**Subject:** "Quick follow-up on [specific feature discussed]"

"Hi [Name],

Thanks again for your time on [day]. I enjoyed learning about [specific challenge].

You mentioned [specific pain point]—I wanted to share [relevant resource/case study] that shows how [similar company] addressed this.

Would you have 15 minutes [day/day] to discuss next steps?

[Your name]"

### After Proposal (1 week)
**Subject:** "Any questions on the proposal?"

"Hi [Name],

I wanted to check in on the proposal I sent over last [day]. I know you mentioned reviewing it with [stakeholder]—how did that conversation go?

Happy to hop on a quick call to address any questions or make adjustments.

What works for your schedule?"

### Gone Dark (2 weeks)
**Subject:** "Did I lose you?"

"Hi [Name],

I haven't heard back and want to make sure I didn't miss something.

A quick reply would help me understand where you're at:
- Still interested, just busy
- Priorities changed
- Went another direction

Either way, I appreciate you letting me know.

[Name]"

### Breakup Email
**Subject:** "Closing the loop"

"Hi [Name],

I've reached out a few times and haven't heard back, so I'm going to assume the timing isn't right.

I'll close out my follow-up, but feel free to reach out whenever [solution type] becomes a priority again.

Wishing you and [Company] all the best."
