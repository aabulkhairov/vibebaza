# Customer Pain Point Discovery

Uncover and articulate the pain points that drive purchasing decisions.

## Prompt Template

```
Identify customer pain points for:

**Product/Service:** [What you offer]
**Target Customer:** [Job title, industry, company size]
**Job-to-be-Done:** [What they're trying to accomplish]
**Current Alternatives:** [How they solve it now]
**Your Solution Category:** [Type of product]

Generate:
1. Functional pain points (task-related)
2. Emotional pain points (feelings)
3. Social pain points (perception/status)
4. Financial pain points (cost/ROI)
5. Process pain points (workflow)
6. Pain point statements for marketing copy
```

## Pain Point Categories

### Functional Pain Points
*What's broken or inefficient*
- "It takes too long to..."
- "I can't get accurate data on..."
- "The current process requires manual..."
- "There's no way to..."

### Emotional Pain Points
*How they feel*
- "I'm frustrated that..."
- "I'm worried about..."
- "I'm overwhelmed by..."
- "I'm embarrassed when..."

### Social Pain Points
*How others perceive them*
- "My team thinks I'm..."
- "Leadership questions..."

### Financial Pain Points
*Money and resources*
- "We're wasting money on..."
- "We can't afford to..."
- "The ROI is unclear..."
- "Hidden costs keep..."

## Pain Point Depth Levels

**Level 1 - Surface:** "We need a better CRM"
**Level 2 - Impact:** "We're losing deals because of poor follow-up"
**Level 3 - Root Cause:** "Reps spend 30% of time on data entry instead of selling"
**Level 4 - Emotional:** "I'm afraid we'll miss our number and I'll lose my job"

## Using Pain Points in Copy

**Headline:** Address the pain directly
"Stop Losing Deals to Poor Follow-Up"

**Body:** Agitate, then solve
"When your reps spend hours on data entry, they're not selling. And when they're not selling, deals slip away."

**CTA:** Promise relief
"Get 10 Hours Back Per Rep, Per Week"
