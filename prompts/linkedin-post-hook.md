# LinkedIn Post Hooks

Generate attention-grabbing opening lines that stop the scroll on LinkedIn.

## Prompt Template

```
Create 10 LinkedIn post hooks for:

**Topic:** [What the post is about]
**Target Audience:** [Who you want to reach]
**Post Goal:** [Engagement/Thought leadership/Lead gen/Brand awareness]
**Tone:** [Professional/Conversational/Provocative/Inspirational]

Requirements:
- First line must be compelling (it's all people see before "see more")
- Create curiosity or tension
- Avoid clickbait that doesn't deliver
- Mix formats: questions, statements, stories, contrarian takes
```

## Hook Categories

### Story Hooks
- "Last week, I made a $50,000 mistake."
- "The best advice I ever got came from an Uber driver."
- "In 2019, I almost quit my job. Here's what happened instead."

### Contrarian Hooks
- "Unpopular opinion: Cold calling isn't dead."
- "Everything you've been told about marketing funnels is wrong."
- "The 'best' sales advice is actually destroying your pipeline."

### Question Hooks
- "What would you do with 10 extra hours per week?"
- "Why do 90% of startups fail at the same growth stage?"
- "Is your sales process actually helping or hurting?"

### Data Hooks
- "I analyzed 1,000 cold emails. Here's what actually works."
- "We tested 50 subject lines. The winner surprised everyone."
- "After 500 sales calls, I discovered one pattern."

### Vulnerability Hooks
- "I've been in sales for 10 years and I still get rejected daily."
- "Here's what I wish someone told me before my first marketing role."
- "I used to think I was good at this. Then I saw the data."

## Best Practices

- Keep hooks under 150 characters
- Use line breaks strategically
- Match the hook energy to the content
- Deliver on the promise in the post body
