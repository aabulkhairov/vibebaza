# Sales Discovery Questions

Create discovery questions that uncover real needs and qualify opportunities.

## Prompt Template

```
Generate discovery questions for:

**Product/Service:** [What you sell]
**Target Persona:** [Job title, responsibilities]
**Common Pain Points:** [Problems you solve]
**Buying Process:** [Typical stakeholders, timeline]
**Competitive Landscape:** [Main alternatives]

Create questions for:
1. Situation questions (current state)
2. Problem questions (challenges)
3. Implication questions (impact)
4. Need-payoff questions (value of solving)
5. Budget/Authority/Timeline questions
6. Competitive questions
```

## Question Frameworks

### SPIN Questions

**Situation** (Understand current state)
- "Walk me through how your team currently handles [process]?"
- "What tools/systems are you using for [function]?"
- "How long have you been doing it this way?"

**Problem** (Identify challenges)
- "What's the biggest challenge you face with [area]?"
- "Where do things typically break down?"
- "What's frustrating about your current approach?"

**Implication** (Explore impact)
- "How does that impact your team's [productivity/revenue/goals]?"
- "What happens when [problem] isn't addressed?"
- "Have you calculated what this costs you annually?"

**Need-Payoff** (Visualize solution)
- "If you could solve [problem], what would that mean for your team?"
- "How would [specific improvement] affect your [KPI]?"
- "What would success look like 12 months from now?"

### Qualification Questions (BANT+)

**Budget**
- "Have you allocated budget for solving this?"
- "What range are you considering for this type of solution?"

**Authority**
- "Who else would be involved in this decision?"
- "What does your evaluation process typically look like?"

**Need**
- "On a scale of 1-10, how urgent is solving this?"
- "What's driving the timing on this initiative?"

**Timeline**
- "When would you ideally want to have this implemented?"
- "Are there any deadlines driving this?"

## Advanced Questions

- "What would make you say 'no' to a solution like ours?"
- "What have you tried before? What worked/didn't work?"
- "If nothing changes, where will you be in a year?"
