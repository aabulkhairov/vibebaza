# Call-to-Action Generator

Craft CTAs that drive clicks and conversions.

## Prompt Template

```
Create CTAs for:

**Context:** [Landing page/Email/Ad/Blog post]
**Action Desired:** [Sign up/Buy/Download/Book/Contact]
**Offer:** [What they get]
**Audience:** [Who you're targeting]
**Urgency Level:** [None/Low/Medium/High]
**Button/Link:** [Is this for a button or text link]

Generate:
1. Primary CTA (5 options)
2. Secondary CTA (3 options)
3. Micro-copy for below CTA
4. Urgency variations
```

## CTA Formulas
