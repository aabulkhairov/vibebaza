# Sales Objection Responses

Create compelling responses to sales objections that advance deals.

## Prompt Template

```
Create responses to this sales objection:

**Objection:** "[Exact objection phrase]"
**Context:**
- Product/Service: [What you're selling]
- Deal Stage: [Discovery/Demo/Proposal/Negotiation]
- Prospect Type: [Title, company size]
- Likely Root Cause: [What's really behind the objection]

Generate responses using:
1. Feel-Felt-Found method
2. Question-based response (dig deeper)
3. Reframe approach
4. Social proof response
5. Direct address response
```

## Common Objections & Frameworks

### "It's too expensive"
**Reframe:** "I understand budget is important. Let me ask—what's the cost of not solving [problem] for another quarter?"

**Value Math:** "At $X/month, you'd need to [achieve specific result] to see ROI. Based on what you shared, that seems very achievable. Does that math work for you?"

### "We're happy with our current solution"
**Curiosity:** "That's great—what do you like most about it? ...And if you could wave a magic wand and improve one thing?"

### "I need to think about it"
**Clarify:** "Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help you think it through—what specific aspects are you weighing?"

### "Send me more information"
**Qualify:** "Happy to—what specific information would be most helpful? I want to send exactly what you need for your decision."

### "Not right now"
**Timeline:** "I hear you. When you say 'not right now,' what would need to change for this to become a priority?"

## Response Framework: LAER

- **Listen:** Fully hear the objection
- **Acknowledge:** Show understanding
- **Explore:** Ask questions to understand
- **Respond:** Address the real concern
