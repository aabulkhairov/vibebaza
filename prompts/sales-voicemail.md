# Sales Voicemail Script

Craft voicemails that get returned calls.

## Prompt Template

```
Create a voicemail script for:

**Scenario:**
- Call Type: [Cold/Follow-up/Warm]
- Previous Contact: [None/Email sent/Spoke before]
- Reason for Call: [Introduction/Meeting/Information]

**Prospect:**
- Name/Title: [Who you're calling]
- Company: [Their company]
- Relevant Trigger: [Why now]

**Value Hook:** [What's in it for them]
**Callback Request:** [Action you want]
**Time Constraint:** [Keep under 30 seconds]

Generate:
1. Primary voicemail script
2. Alternative scripts (2 variations)
3. Follow-up voicemail
4. Final attempt voicemail
```

## Voicemail Framework

### Structure (30 seconds max)
1. **Greeting** (5 sec): Name and company
2. **Hook** (10 sec): Why they should care
3. **CTA** (5 sec): What you want
4. **Close** (10 sec): Name, number (twice), best time

## Script Examples

### Cold Voicemail
"Hi [Name], this is [Your name] with [Company].

I'm calling because we've helped companies like [similar company] reduce their [pain point metric] by [result]—and I have a few ideas for [Company].

If you have 10 minutes this week, I'd love to share them.

My number is [number]. Again, that's [Your name] at [number].

Looking forward to connecting."

### Follow-up Voicemail
"[Name], [Your name] from [Company] following up.

I sent you [an email/information] about [topic] last [day]. Rather than keep emailing, I wanted to reach out directly.

If [solving problem] is on your radar, I'd love a quick call.

[Number]. Thanks, [Name]."

### Referral Voicemail
"Hi [Name], [Your name] here. [Mutual connection] mentioned you're the right person to speak with about [topic].

We recently helped [their company] with [similar situation], and [connection] thought there might be value in us connecting.

Would love to chat—[number]. Thanks!"

## Best Practices

- Keep under 30 seconds
- Speak slowly and clearly
- Say phone number twice
- Give a specific reason to call back
- Don't leave more than 2-3 voicemails total
- Pair with email follow-up
