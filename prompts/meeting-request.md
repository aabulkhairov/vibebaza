## Meeting Request Frameworks

"Hi [Name],

I've been researching [Company] and noticed [trigger/observation].

Would you have 15 minutes this week for a quick conversation? I promise to keep it focused and valuable.

[Link to calendar / Suggest 2-3 times]"

### Referral Approach
**Subject:** "[Mutual connection] suggested we connect"

"Hi [Name],

[Mutual connection] mentioned you're working on [initiative/challenge]. They thought it might be valuable for us to connect.

We recently helped [similar company] with [similar situation], and I have a few ideas that might be relevant.

Do you have 20 minutes this week to explore?"

### Direct Ask
**Subject:** "Quick call about [topic]?"

"Hi [Name],

[One sentence about why you're reaching out]

I'd like to share [specific thing] that's helped teams like yours [specific outcome].

15 minutes—[Day] or [Day] work for you?"
