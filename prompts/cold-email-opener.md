# Cold Email Opening Lines

Generate compelling opening lines that capture attention and drive responses in cold outreach.

## Prompt Template

```
Create 10 cold email opening lines for the following scenario:

**Target Persona:** [Job title and company type]
**Product/Service:** [What you're selling]
**Key Pain Point:** [Main problem you solve]
**Tone:** [Professional/Casual/Witty]

Requirements:
- Avoid generic openers like "I hope this email finds you well"
- Personalization hooks for name/company/industry
- Under 15 words each
- Mix of question, statement, and observation formats
```

## Example Output

For a sales automation tool targeting VP of Sales:

1. **Question Hook:** "Quick question: How many hours did your team spend on manual data entry last week?"
2. **Observation:** "Noticed [Company] just expanded the sales team—congrats on the growth."
3. **Pattern Interrupt:** "This isn't another sales pitch. It's a 2-minute ROI conversation."
4. **Social Proof:** "Your competitor [Company] cut their sales cycle by 40%. Here's how."
5. **Challenge:** "Most sales teams waste 30% of their week on admin. Yours probably isn't different."

## Best Practices

- Research before reaching out—generic = delete
- Lead with value, not features
- Create curiosity without clickbait
- Test multiple approaches and track results
