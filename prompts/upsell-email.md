# Upsell and Cross-Sell Email

Craft emails that expand customer relationships and increase revenue.

## Prompt Template

```
Create an upsell/cross-sell email for:

**Current Product:** [What they have]
**Proposed Product:** [What you're offering]
**Customer Profile:**
- Account age: [Time as customer]
- Usage pattern: [How they use current product]
- Success metrics: [Results they've achieved]
- Potential trigger: [Why now]

**Value of Upgrade:** [Benefits they'll gain]
**Price Difference:** [Investment required]
**Offer:** [Any incentive]

Generate:
1. Subject lines (3 options)
2. Email body
3. ROI justification
4. Soft-ask alternative
```

## Upsell Frameworks

### Success-Based Upsell
"You've been crushing it with [current product]—[specific result]. The next level? [Upgraded product] could help you [additional outcome]."

### Usage-Based Upsell
"I noticed you're approaching your [limit]. Before you hit the ceiling, I wanted to share options for [upgraded plan]."

### Feature-Based Upsell
"Based on your use of [feature], I think you'd get a lot of value from [advanced feature in higher tier]."

### Time-Based Upsell
"You've been with us for [duration]—thank you! As a valued customer, I wanted to give you early access to [new product/feature]."

## Email Structure

1. **Personalized opener** - Reference their specific success
2. **Bridge** - Connect success to opportunity
3. **Value proposition** - What they gain
4. **Social proof** - Similar customers who upgraded
5. **Soft CTA** - Low-pressure next step

## Example Email

**Subject:** Your results are impressive—let's accelerate them

"Hi [Name],

I was reviewing your account and noticed [specific achievement]—that's outstanding.

Many customers at your stage find that [upgraded feature] helps them [specific additional outcome]. In fact, [similar company] saw [result] within [timeframe] of upgrading.

Would you be open to a 15-minute call to explore if [upgrade] makes sense for [Company]? No pressure either way.

[Name]"

## Best Practices

- Lead with their success, not your product
- Quantify the additional value
- Make it easy to say yes AND no
- Time it with usage milestones
