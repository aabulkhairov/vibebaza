# LinkedIn Connection Request

Craft connection requests that get accepted and open conversations.

## Prompt Template

```
Create a LinkedIn connection request for:

**Target:**
- Name/Title: [Who you're connecting with]
- Company: [Where they work]
- Connection Reason: [Why you want to connect]

**Your Context:**
- Your Role: [What you do]
- Mutual Elements: [Connections, groups, interests]
- Goal: [What you hope to achieve]

**Personalization Hook:** [Something specific about them]

Generate:
1. Standard connection request (300 char limit)
2. No-note approach guidance
3. Follow-up message after accepted
4. Alternative angles (3 options)
```

## Connection Request Types

### Mutual Connection
"Hi [Name], I see we're both connected to [Mutual]. I've been following your posts on [topic] and would love to connect. [Your name]"

### Content Engagement
"Hi [Name], your recent post about [topic] really resonated—especially [specific point]. Would love to connect and learn more about your work at [Company]."

### Industry Peer
"Hi [Name], I'm also in [industry/role] and have been impressed by what [Company] is building. Would love to connect and share insights."

### Genuine Interest
"Hi [Name], came across your profile while researching [topic]. Your experience with [specific thing] caught my eye. Would love to connect."

### Event-Based
"Hi [Name], saw you're speaking at [event]/attending [conference]. I'll be there too—would love to connect beforehand."

## After Acceptance Message

"Thanks for connecting, [Name]!

I noticed [something about their work/company]. I'm curious—[relevant question about their experience]?

No pitch here, genuinely interested in your perspective."

## What NOT to Do

❌ Generic "I'd like to add you to my network"
❌ Immediate sales pitch
❌ No personalization
❌ Lying about mutual connections
❌ Copy-paste obvious

## Character Limit Strategy (300 chars)

**Formula:** Personal hook + Connection reason + Sign off

**Example (298 chars):**
"Hi Sarah, your post on RevOps alignment was spot-on—we're tackling the same challenges at [Company]. Would love to connect and exchange ideas on bridging sales and marketing. - [Your name]"
