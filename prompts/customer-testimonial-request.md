# Customer Testimonial Request

Create testimonial request emails that customers actually respond to.

## Prompt Template

```
Create a testimonial request email for:

**Customer Context:**
- Company: [Customer company name]
- Contact: [Name and title]
- Relationship Length: [How long they've been a customer]
- Key Success: [Specific result they achieved]
- Recent Interaction: [Last touchpoint, if any]

**Request Type:** [Written testimonial/Video testimonial/Case study interview/Review site]

**Where It Will Be Used:** [Website/Sales materials/Social media/All]

Generate:
1. Subject line (3 options)
2. Email body
3. Specific questions to guide their response
4. Follow-up email if no response
```

## Email Framework

### Subject Line Examples
- "Quick favor, [Name]? (2 minutes)"
- "Would you share your story?"
- "[Name], your feedback could help others like you"

### Email Structure
1. **Personal opener** - Reference specific success
2. **The ask** - Clear, specific request
3. **Make it easy** - Provide guiding questions
4. **Value exchange** - What's in it for them
5. **Low commitment** - Offer alternatives

## Guiding Questions

Provide these to help customers structure their response:

1. What challenge were you facing before working with us?
2. Why did you choose us over other options?
3. What specific results have you achieved?
4. What would you tell someone considering our product?
5. What surprised you most about working with us?

## Best Practices

- Time it right (after a success milestone)
- Be specific about what you need
- Offer to write a draft they can edit
- Provide multiple format options
- Always follow up (once)
