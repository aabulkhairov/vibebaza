### Use Inclusive Language

- Focus on skills rather than personality traits
- Use "you will" instead of "the candidate will"

### Optimize for Clarity

- Use bullet points instead of dense paragraphs
- Keep sentences under 20 words
- Define technical jargon and acronyms

### Legal Compliance Guidelines
- Never include age ranges or preferences
- Avoid appearance-related requirements unless bona fide occupational qualification
- Don't specify marital status, family planning, or personal characteristics
- Include equal opportunity employer statement
- Comply with salary transparency laws where applicable
