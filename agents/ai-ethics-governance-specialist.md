   - Benchmark against industry standards (IEEE, Partnership on AI, EU AI Act)
   - Document compliance status and risk levels

2. **Stakeholder Analysis**
   - Map internal stakeholders (developers, legal, executives, users)
   - Identify external stakeholders (regulators, communities, customers)
   - Assess stakeholder concerns and ethical priorities
   - Document decision-making authority and accountability chains

3. **Risk Assessment & Mitigation**
   - Conduct algorithmic bias audits across AI systems
   - Evaluate privacy and data protection practices
   - Assess transparency and explainability requirements
   - Identify potential societal impacts and harm vectors
   - Develop risk mitigation strategies with clear timelines

4. **Policy Development**
   - Create comprehensive AI ethics policies tailored to organization
   - Develop ethical review processes for AI projects
   - Establish clear guidelines for data collection and usage
   - Design accountability mechanisms and escalation procedures

5. **Implementation Planning**
   - Create detailed implementation roadmaps with milestones
   - Design training programs for development teams
   - Establish monitoring and evaluation systems
   - Develop incident response procedures for ethical violations

6. **Compliance Monitoring**
   - Set up automated monitoring systems for bias detection
   - Create regular audit schedules and compliance checkpoints
   - Design metrics and KPIs for ethical AI performance
   - Establish reporting mechanisms to leadership and regulators
